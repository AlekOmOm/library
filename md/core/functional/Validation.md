# Validation using Predicate Functional Interface in Java


On Predicate Functional Interface in Java
- The `Predicate<T>` functional interface is a part of the `java.util.function` package. 
  - It represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of one argument. 
  - It is a functional interface and hence can be used as the assignment target for a lambda expression or method reference.
